    \item Consequently, these effects are not identifiable in a randomized
    trial (no valid randomization that performs the joint intervention); thus,
    scientific claims obtained from these models are not falsifiable through
    experimentation.
  \item Two routes around ``cross-world'': set identification (of bounds) and

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Modified treatment policies $d(A,W)$.
    \item Exponential tilting.

\begin{frame}{Modified treatment policies}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Consider a hypothetical world where the treatment received is
        some function $d(A,W)$ of the treatment \textit{actually} received
        $A$ and covariates $W$.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{example}[\cite{haneuse2013estimation}]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the impact of operating time on outcomes for patients
          undergoing surgical resection for non-small-cell lung cancer.
        \item We can answer this using a hypothetical intervention
          $d(A,W) = A-\delta$ for user-supplied $\delta$.
        \item Denote the post-intervention exposure $A_\delta = d(A,W)$
        \item Non-parametric definition of effects with an interpretation
          that is familiar to users of OLS regression adjustment.
        \item Requires assuming piecewise smooth invertibility of
        $d(\cdot, w)$.

\begin{frame}{Exponential tilting}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Consider an intervention that changes the exposure distribution
    conditional on covariates from $g(a\mid w)$ to
    $g_\delta(a\mid w)$, where
    \begin{equation*}
      g_\delta(a \mid w) \propto \exp(\delta a) g(a \mid w)
    \end{equation*}
  \item Denote by $A_\delta$ a draw from post-intervention distribution
    $g_\delta$.

  \begin{example}[\cite{kennedy2017nonparametric}]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Incremental propensity score interventions.} For binary $A$,
      \begin{equation*}
        g_\delta(1 \mid w) = \frac{\delta g(1 \mid w)}{\delta g(1 \mid w) + 1
          - g(1\mid w)},
      \end{equation*}

   intervention effect (PIE) of $A$ on $Y$ as

          Y(A, Z)\}}_{\text{direct effect}}.
    \end{align*}
  \item Identification and estimation of $\E\{Y(A_{\delta}, Z(A_{\delta})\}$
    has been done \cite[e.g.,][]{diaz2012population,kennedy2017nonparametric}.

  \item Assume convergence of certain second-order terms --- e.g.,

  \item Such intervention policies account for the natural value of the
    intervention $A$ directly yet are interpretable as the imposition of an
    altered intervention mechanism.
  \item Identification conditions for assessing the parameter of interest under
    such interventions appear technically complex (at first).

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shifts of the form $d(A,W)$ are considerably more interesting since
      these are realistic intervention policies.
    \item Example: consider an individual with an extremely high immune response
      but whose baseline covariates $W$ suggest we shift the response still
      higher. Such a shift may not be biologically plausible (impossible, even)
      but we cannot account for this if the shift is only a function of $W$.
    \item The authors build IPW, outcome regression, and non-iterative doubly
      robust estimators, as well as an approach based on MSMs.
    \item Piecewise smooth invertibility: This assumption ensures that we can
      use the change of variable formula when computing integrals over $A$ and
      it is useful to study the estimators that we propose in this paper.
