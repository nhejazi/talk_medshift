Although Fisher made invaluable contributions to the field of statistics, his analysis of the causal association between lung cancer and smoking was flawed by an unwillingness to examine the entire body of data available and prematurely drawn conclusions. His views may also have been influenced by personal and professional conflicts, by his work as a consultant to the tobacco industry, and by the fact that he was himself a smoker.},

	Abstract = {Public health debates about providing HIV antiretroviral therapy to impoverished populations have centred on the relationship between adherence \& risk of drug resistance. Recent data indicate that each antiretroviral therapeutic class has a unique adherence-resistance relationship. Resistance to single protease inhibitor therapy occurs most frequently at moderate to high levels of adherence, resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy occurs at low to moderate levels of adherence, \& resistance to ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor therapy is most likely to occur at middle ranges of adherence. These dynamic relationships should be considered in balancing the individual \& public health benefits of therapy.},
